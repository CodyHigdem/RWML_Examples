    "The simplest example of a parametric approach is linear regression. In linear regression, f is assumed to be a linear combination of the numerical values of the inputs.\n",

    "Drawback is strong assumptions about the true form of the function. Which with real world data makes it hard to actually fit. \n",

    "### nonparametric methods\n",
    "\n",
    "a classification tree is a good example of a nonparametric methods. The depths and complexity of the data isn't fixed based on an assumed function/plot. \n",

    "\n",
    "unsupervised is where there's no identified target variale. supervised you have a large data set and the target variable is known. \n",

    "clustering:\n",

    "dimensionality reduction:\n",
